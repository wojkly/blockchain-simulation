### Network tab

Displays the graph of network nodes - Miners, Full Nodes, Listening Nodes and Light Nodes. Click on a node to show more information.

### Miners tab

Shows detailed information about every active and inactive miner.

### Parameters tab

Lets the user change parameters of the simulation.

### Blockchain

Displays created blockchain in each full node. In a top left corner of the tab, you can switch between Longest Chain and GHOST options to display current main branch. Additionally, you can select which node's blockchain you want to see.

### Charts

Collects and displays the statistics of the simulation.
